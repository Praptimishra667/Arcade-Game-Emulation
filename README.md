# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

I was provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools, I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game **Frogger**.

The aim of this project was to use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, an important programming paradigm that influences the application's architecture and provides performance optimization.

The project is hosted [here](file:///C:/Users/prapt/Downloads/New%20folder/clone.html).

## Steps to Run the Game

1. Open `clone.html` in your browser.

## Game Controls

- **Up Key**: Move player towards the goal.
- **Down Key**: Move player away from the goal.
- **Left Key**: Move player to the left.
- **Right Key**: Move player to the right.

## Game Rules

- Avoid enemies using the given controls and reach the finish line.
- To complete the game, score 10 points.

Good luck!
